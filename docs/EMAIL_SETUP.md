## Testing Email Configuration

### Test Email Sending

To test if your email configuration is working:

1. Sign up for a new account on your ListGenius site
2. Check your email for the welcome message
3. Apply for an affiliate account
4. Check both your email and the admin email

### Debugging Email Issues

If emails aren't sending, check the following:

1. **Check environment variables** - Make sure all required variables are set in `.env.local`
2. **Check SMTP credentials** - Verify your email and password are correct
3. **Check logs** - Look for email-related errors in your application logs
4. **Check spam folder** - Some emails may be flagged as spam initially
5. **Port and security settings** - Ensure `SMTP_PORT` and `SMTP_SECURE` match your provider

Common error messages:

- **"Email transporter not configured"** - Missing or incorrect SMTP credentials
