# Referral Count Fix

## Issue
The affiliate system was showing 5 referrals for the "Unknown User" affiliate, but there were actually 0 referral records in the database.

## Root Cause
The `referralCount` field in the `Affiliate` model was out of sync with the actual `Referral` records. This created a discrepancy where the admin panel showed incorrect referral counts.

## Solution
- Investigated the database and found 0 actual referral records
- The affiliate's `referralCount` field showed 5 but should have been 0
- Corrected the `referralCount` to match the actual number of referral records
- Verified that the admin panel now shows accurate referral counts

## Result
- ✅ Total Referrals: 0 (correct)
- ✅ Unknown User Referrals: 0 (correct)
- ✅ All affiliate metrics now accurate and consistent
